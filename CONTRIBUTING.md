Contributions are welcome but please adhere to some basic guidelines, outlined below.

* __Line endings__ - As this script is written in PowerShell, and intended for use on Microsoft Windows, please ensure files use the standard Microsoft line ending of _carriage return and line feed_ (\r\n).
* __Test your code__ - It's important to ensure what you're attempting to commit doesn't fundamentally break the script, so please test it.
* __Commit messages__ - For continuity, please don't include a full stop (period) at the end of your commit messages first line.  I'm told omitting the period is fairly standard practice and this ties in with other projects.
* __Reference issues where appropriate__ - When working on something that relates to an issue, please comment on the issue to avoid duplicated effort.  Please also reference the issue in a commit or PR for clarification.

## Contributing code
If you spot an improvement you're able to make, please fork the project and submit a Pull Request (PR).  PRs will be reviewed as time allows and may be merged as appropriate but there is no guarantee your PR will be accepted.  Please don't take offence if that's the case, I'm happy to discuss the PR and hope we can come to a happy medium.

## Contributing documentation
There is a wiki for this project, where most documentation can be found.  Corrections and amendments would be gratefully received.

### Translations
If you'd like to translate the wiki that'd be great.  Thanks in advance.

## Reporting issues
